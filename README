GAN based Data Augmentation

The zip has the following files

1. data_preprocessing_and_gan_training.ipynb: the python notebook that primarly cleans the raw data and trains the GAN saves them onto h5 files used for further generation for fake samples

2. Modelling_with_scaling.ipynb: the python notebook that loads the files, performs the data augmentation using GANs, vanilla oversampling and using raw data, and finally use the classifiers

The code files used the following libraries:

a. pandas
b. scikit-learn
c. keras
d. tensorflow
e. matplotlib
f. numpy
g. collections
h. math
i. imblearn (some machines may need a lower version: we also used 0.8.0 for CSIF)

3. creditcard.csv: The dataset file which is straight obtained from Kaggle

4. final_discriminator.h5: the discriminator saved h5 file
5. final_generator.h5: the generator saved h5 file (used for the fake sample generation)
6. final_gan.h5: the entire gan file

7. final_video.mp4: the video file which has our recordings
